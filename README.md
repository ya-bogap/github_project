#Q 1)A
import numpy library from python using import numpy as np 
Give an input function to ask the user for input in integers.
define a function in such a way which appends the list of numbers to the numoy array for fibonacci numbers using if and elif, and use for loop to print the required number of elements. Print the array of numbers.

#Q 1)B
Import numpy library from python using using import numpy as np.
Define a fibonacci list which limits the output to 20 elements only.
Append the generated list (generated_sequence)of numbers to a numpy array(final_array)
Check the result using the print function.

Q 1) C
Create a list fib_list which limits the fibonacci numbers to 20 elements.
Append the first(0) and second(1) values in a fibonacci number to the fib_list.
Now create a for loop which adds the previous two numbers to a result. 
Open a list 2 in which the subsequent number is the quotient of the previous two numbers and append the result_value to the list2.Here the first number is 1.
The generated list of numbers are put into an array called array_quotient.
And again open a list 3 and append zero to the list. The range for list 3 starts from third fibonacci number and ends with the input number.The  subsequent number in this is the result_value  of the difference between the previous two numbers.
The resulted list of numbers are put into an array called array_difference.

Q 1)D
Plot all the resulted list of numbers in each and every case by importing matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
Give plt.plot(array,label) to plot graph and give the label to x-axis ,y-axis and title to the graph and use plt.show() to show the result



Q 2)A
The data is downloaded from the kaggle after signing up.

Q 2)B
Import the panda dataframes using import pandas as pd and then the .csv files are read using pd.read_csv(path of the file). And read the
